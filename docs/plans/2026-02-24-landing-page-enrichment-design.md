# Landing Page Enrichment Design

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Approved
**Approach:** A — Feature Sections (minimal structural change, maximum content impact)

## Constraints

- Fleet-first messaging, secondary for shops/drivers
- Startup/modern tone ("the smarter way")
- Only show live features (no invoicing)
- No fake social proof
- Keep "Coming Soon" for app store CTAs
- Medium depth: hero + 4-5 sections + footer

## Section 1: Hero (updated copy)

**Headline:**
> The Smarter Way to Manage Your Fleet's Maintenance

**Subheading:**
> From daily inspections to emergency breakdowns — FixiTruck brings fleet management, vehicle tracking, and repair shop matching into one platform.

CTAs unchanged (App Store / Google Play with "Coming Soon").

## Section 2: How It Works (copy refresh)

**Tagline:** "From breakdown report to completed repair in three steps."

- **Step 1: Report** — "Driver reports a breakdown with location, photos, and symptoms — our AI helps assess severity and diagnostics."
- **Step 2: Match** — "FixiTruck broadcasts the request to nearby verified shops, who review details and submit competitive offers."
- **Step 3: Repair** — "Accept the best offer, track repair progress in real-time, and get your truck back on the road."

## Section 3: Daily Operations (NEW section)

**Title:** "Built for the Road, Every Day"
**Tagline:** "FixiTruck isn't just for breakdowns — it's your fleet's daily operating system."

Three cards:

1. **Pre-Trip Inspections** — "Digital DVIR with zone-based checklists, defect photo capture, and pass/fail tracking. Keep your fleet compliant and road-ready."
2. **Vehicle Management** — "Register trucks and trailers, track assignments, store documents, and monitor mileage — all in one place."
3. **Fleet & Driver Management** — "Invite drivers, manage join requests, assign vehicles, and oversee your entire fleet's operations from a single dashboard."

## Section 4: Features by Role (enriched, reordered)

**Title:** "One Platform for Every Role"

1. **For Fleet Managers** (moved to first) — "Monitor repair requests, manage drivers and vehicles, track inspections, and control maintenance costs — all from one dashboard."
2. **For Drivers** — "Run pre-trip inspections, report breakdowns with AI-assisted diagnostics, compare repair offers, and track progress from your phone."
3. **For Repair Shops** — "Receive repair requests automatically based on your location and availability. Submit offers, manage jobs, and grow your business."

## Section 5: Footer (updated tagline)

> Fleet management platform for trucking — inspections, maintenance, and daily operations.
